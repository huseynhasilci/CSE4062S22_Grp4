### Predict Critical Situation 
We are using the company's bug report data in our project and our aim is to estimate the priority order of the incoming errors using Issue type , employee type and worker. If critical situations are not entered as the correct value or if they are not detected as critical situations, it can cause big problems inside or outside the company. That's why priority is the target label for us. We will take the first hundred rows for testing. We will use the remaining rows for training. We decided to use decision trees in this application because there are too many nominal values in the project. 
### Data Statictics 
Class Labels:Issue Type,Employe type,Woker.Type of All Labels  are nominal. 
Target Label (Column): Priority (Nominal). 
We reserved 20% of the dataset for testing. We set aside 80% for training. 
We will use the remaining lines for training.
